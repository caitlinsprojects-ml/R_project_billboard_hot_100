## Data Science in R Final Project

This repo is for your final project report for Data Science in R, which will be submitted as a group.

This repo includes the raw data used as a means to exercise the R skills and analyses learned in this course, as well as the R Markdown document (containing the code and comments) and knitted HTML file (both created and run in RStudio).
